#### Repository structure:

* `display_source` - Source data for each display item, included for convenience.

* `scripts`

	* `analyses` - R scripts to generate reported models and to run key statistical tests

	* `broad_analysis_processing` - R scripts for analyzing and processing files for broad pangenome analysis
