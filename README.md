# pangenome_pseudogene_null

Code for manuscript: "Pseudogenes as a neutral reference for detecting selection in prokaryotic pangenomes"


### Repository structure:

* `scripts`

	* `analyses` - R scripts to generate reported models and to run key statistical tests

    * `broad_analysis_processing` - R scripts for analyzing and processing files for broad pangenome analysis

	* `cleanup` - R scripts generating cleaned-up tables (e.g., tables of plotted values for all main plots)

	* `display_items` - R scripts for generating display items

	* `indepth_analysis_processing` - R scripts for analyzing and processing files for indepth pangenome analysis

	* `preprocessing` - R and Python scripts for preprocessing raw and intermediate files

	* `sanity_checks` - Quick scripts for running checks of specific results reported in the manuscript (i.e., regenerating results with independent code).

	* `text_results` - Small scripts for computing values reported in text (intended to be run on datafiles distributed on FigShare repository)
